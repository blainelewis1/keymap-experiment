# KeyMap

This repository contains the code for the KeyMap experiment. More information about KeyMap can be found at http://blainelewis.ca/KeyMap. The experiment was used for a paper on improving keyboard shortcut memory. https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376483

It was then adopted into a [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keymap/fpminkfnndfokkmoobbngdpnijbcajkl) and [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blainelewis1/keymap) you can use to incorporate a KeyMap into your own applications.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40blainelewis1%2Fkeymap.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40blainelewis1%2Fkeymap)

The experiment can still be run at http://blainelewis.ca/keymap-experiment.
