# Information Consent Letter for Online Studies

**Title of the study: Evaluation of Human-Computer Interaction Techniques**

_Principal Investigator/Faculty Supervisor:_ Dr. Daniel Vogel, Assistant Professor, School of Computer Science, University of Waterloo, Canada, 519-888-4567 ext. 33561, dvogel@uwaterloo.ca

Graduate Student Investigators:

- Blaine Lewis, b2lewis@uwaterloo.ca
- Greg d’Eon, gldeon@uwaterloo.ca

To help you make an informed decision regarding your participation, this letter will explain what the study is about, the possible risks and benefits, and your rights as a research participant.

## What is the study about?

You are invited to participate in a research study examining methods for people to interact with computers and other digital devices. In this experiment, you will issue computer application commands using a variety of methods such as menus, toolbars, and keyboard shortcuts. This is important because understanding the characteristics and performance of human-computer interaction can discover new interaction methods and improve existing interaction methods. The results of this study contribute to graduate theses and faculty research.

## 1. Your responsibilities as a participant

### What does participation involve?

Participation in the study will consist of a 10-minute-long session. In certain cases, you will also be asked to participate in one or more shorter follow-up sessions (each 24 to 48 hours after the previous session). During a session, you be asked to perform typical laptop tasks like typing and clicking while intermittently issuing commands using a specific graphical user interface or device input method.

During the experiment, you may also be asked for your opinion of the techniques and tasks regarding factors such as overall preference, fatigue, comfort, speed, accuracy, utility, suitability, etc. You may decline to respond to questions if you wish. If you wish to decline a written question, leave it blank.

Your computer interactions will also be captured and stored in a computer log file.

### Who may participate in the study?

In order to participate in the study: you must be able to enter text on a computer and control a computer cursor using a mouse, touchpad, or similar pointing device.

## 2. Your rights as a participant

### What are the possible benefits of the study?

Participation in this study may not provide any personal benefit to you. The study will benefit the academic community and society in general by contributing a better understanding of human-computer interaction and potentially inventing new methods of interaction.

### Will I receive payment for participating in the study?

In appreciation of your time, you will receive $2.50 for the first session and $1 for the followup session. If you begin a session but decide to withdraw, your participation in the study will end and you will be remunerated for the proportion of what you completed, up to half the full session remuneration. Please contact Blaine Lewis <blaine.lewis@uwaterloo.ca> or Greg d’Eon <gldeon@uwaterloo.ca> for instructions to receive partial remuneration if you withdraw.

### What are the risks associated with the study?

There is potential for minor discomfort or fatigue from performing repeated tasks, but the physical requirements of the task are like normal computer usage and/or common real-world tasks. We will minimize this risk by requiring and/or encouraging rest breaks.

The study server is hosted by Amazon, when information is transmitted or stored on the internet, privacy cannot be guaranteed. There is always a risk your responses may be intercepted by a third party (e.g., government agencies, hackers).

### Is participation in the study voluntary?

Your participation in this study is voluntary. You may decide to withdraw from the study at any time by communicating this to the researcher.

### Will my identity be known?

The research team will know which data is from your participation, but all data will be anonymized for analysis, reporting, and public data sharing.

### Will my information be kept confidential?

There will be no association between your identify and the research data as you are not asked to provide your name or any identifying information. In all cases, participants will only be referred to using generic labels (P1, P2, …) or collectively as a group (Group A, Group B,…). The research data will be accessible by the study investigators as well as the broader scientific community. More specifically, the data may be posted on public databases and/or made available to other researchers upon publication, so that data may be inspected and analyzed by other researchers. The data that will be shared will not contain any information that could be used to identify you (e.g., worker ID).

## 3. Questions, comments, or concerns

### Who is sponsoring/funding this study?

This study is funded/sponsored by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC), the Province of Ontario, and the University of Waterloo.

### Has the study received ethics clearance?

This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee (ORE# 22114). If you have questions for the Committee contact the Office of Research Ethics at 1-519-888-4567 ext. 36005 or ore-ceo@uwaterloo.ca.

### Who should I contact if I have questions regarding my participation in the study?

If you have any questions regarding this study, or would like additional information to assist you in reaching a decision about participation, please contact Blaine Lewis <blaine.lewis@uwaterloo.ca> or Greg d’Eon <gldeon@uwaterloo.ca> or Dr. Daniel Vogel at 516.888.4567 x33561 or by email at dvogel@uwaterloo.ca. You can also contact any member of the research team listed at the top of this consent letter.
